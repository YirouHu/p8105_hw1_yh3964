# Problem 1

## Load the dataset “early_january_weather”

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

## Description of the dataset

This dataset is a weather-related dataset which contains the information
about the hourly 358 observations about the first fifteen days of
January. Given that 15 days have 360 hours, two observations seem to be
missing in this dataset. Additionally, this dataset’s mean temperature
is 40 F. The dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns, and the detailed
information is as follows:

origin: The origin variable, which indicates the source from which the
weather data comes, is of the character type.
