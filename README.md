Summary: This repository contains my solutions for P8105 Homework 1. In Problem 1, I describe and analyze the early_january_weather dataset by summarizing its variables, calculating descriptive statistics such as the mean temperature, and creating a scatterplot of temperature over time colored by humidity to illustrate daily patterns and overall trends. In Problem 2, I construct a tibble with numeric, logical, character, and factor variables, explore which types allow meaningful calculation of means, and use as.numeric to investigate how R handles type conversion.

Self-reflection: During the process of solving the homework assignment, I found that the '.gitignore' file was missing, and this issue was solved by recreating a new repository and deleting the previous one. Secondly, while reviewing what we had learned, I noticed the importance of committing at each step of the work, so I re-committed at each step instead of making a single commit.
